# Simple Resšo Music Player Clone

This project is a basic recreation of the popular Resšo music player interface, focusing on the visual layout and core functionalities.

### Inspiration

Resšo is a widely used music streaming platform known for its clean and intuitive design. This project aims to capture the essence of that design and provide a simple, playable music experience.

### Features

* **Playback Controls:** Play, pause, stop, and adjust the volume using on-screen buttons.
* **Song Progress:** Visually track the progress of the currently playing song.
* **Minimalist Design:** Mimics the clean and user-friendly aesthetic of Resšo.

### Technologies Used

* HTML: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
* CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the music player, including layout, buttons, and progress bar.
* JavaScript: Manages user interactions with the playback controls, updates the song progress, and potentially handles basic audio playback functionality (depending on implementation).

**Note:** This is a simplified version, and audio playback might require additional libraries or integration with existing audio APIs depending on the chosen approach.

### Running the Project

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
2. **Open the Player:**
   - Open `index.html` (or the main HTML file) in your web browser.
